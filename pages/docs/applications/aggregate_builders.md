Having defined the aggregate model, and the associate aggregate command and event handlers, 
we use the `AggregateBuilder` builder 
to wire these all together and produce a `AggregateSpec`. 

An `AggregateSpec` represents everything Simple Sourcing needs to know about a single aggregate.

```java
AggregateSpec userSpec = AggregateBuilder.<UserKey, UserCommand, UserEvent, Optional<User>>newBuilder()
                .withName("user")
                .withSerdes(avroAggregateSerdes)
                .withResourceNamingStrategy(new PrefixResourceNamingStrategy("application_avro_"))
                .withInitialValue((k) -> Optional.empty())
                .withAggregator(UserEvent.getAggregator())
                .withCommandHandler(UserCommand.getCommandHandler())
                .build();
```

We can define multiple aggregate types, each with their own `AggregateSpec`,
then assemble them all with the [`EventSourcingApp` DSL](application_builder.html), and start the application.

The `EventSourcingApp` DSL also has an `addAggregate` method that provides an `AggregateBuilder`. 
With this pattern, you provide a function that applies the build steps, and don't have to instantiate the builder directly.

 ```java
 new EventSourcingApp()
	 .<UserKey, UserCommand, UserEvent, Optional<User>>addAggregate(builder -> builder
	        .withName(aggregateName)
	        .withSerdes(avroAggregateSerdes)
	        .withResourceNamingStrategy(namingStrategy)
	        .withInitialValue((k) -> Optional.empty())
	        .withAggregator(UserEvent.getAggregator())
	        .withCommandHandler(UserCommand.getCommandHandler())
 ```
