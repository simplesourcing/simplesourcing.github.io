## Including Simple Sourcing in your project

![](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.simplesource/simplesource-command-api/badge.svg)

Include dependencies in you build file:

* Group ID: `io.simplesource`
* Artifact ID: `simplesource-command-<module>`
* Version: `?.?.?` - Latest version in Maven Central, as in above badge.

Where `<module>` is one or more of:
* `api` - core API (required)
* `kafka` - core Kafka implementation (required)
* `serialization` - serialization helpers (recommended)
* `testutils` - testing utilities (optional)

## Getting the source

#### [Core repo](https://github.com/simplesourcing/simplesource)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simplesourcing/simplesource.git
```

#### [Example repo](https://github.com/simplesourcing/simplesource-examples)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simplesourcing/simplesource-examples.git
```

## Local build and run

For comprehensive information on local development setup, please visit the [setup page](/setup.html).

### Pre-requisites

Ensure your local developer machine has the following tools installed 

   * [Java 8 SDK or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
   * [Maven 3.5.x](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
   * [Docker](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)
   
### Docker

We have used Docker to allow developers to easily run a full suite of Kafka components locally.
Docker isn't a requirement to use Simple Sourcing. We have found Docker provides 
a productive development environment where software engineers each get their own independent
test environment they can tear down and recreate in seconds.

### IntelliJ setup

If you choose to use IntelliJ as your IDE, make sure you have the Maven and Lombok plugins installed.

## Running examples

Take a look in the [Example repo](https://github.com/simplesourcing/simplesource-examples) for some working examples of event sourcing systems using
Simple Sourcing. 

Each example has the following structure

* `src/main/avro` - Avro schema definitions for aggregate key, commands, events and projections
* `src/main/java` - Example runner along with all command handlers and projectors
* `src/test/java` - Unit and property based tests


Each of the example applications has one or more `Runner` classes with main methods to run simple tests of the included aggregate types. Run these from your IDE or from the command line using Maven

### User example (Avro)

1. **Start the backend**
    
    From the project root folder:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

1. **Start the backend**

    ```bash
    cd examples/user
    mvn install &&  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.simplesource.example.user.avro.UserAvroRunner
    ```

### Auction example

The dependencies and the front end run in Docker. The backend is run locally.

1. **Starting the dependencies**
    
    ```bash
    cd examples/auction
    docker-compose up
    ```

    Make sure that you can resolve `broker`, `mongo`, and `schema_registry` as
    `127.0.0.1`.

1. **Starting the backend**
    
    ```bash
    cd examples/auction
    ./runApp.sh
    ```

1. **Starting the streams application**

    ````
    cd examples/auction
    ./runStreams.sh
    ```

1. **Starting the front end** 
    
    *In Docker:*
    
    ```bash
    cd examples/auction-frontend
    docker-compose up
    ```
    
    *Or locally:*
    
    You will need a recent version of Node.js with npm
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    cd examples/auction-frontend
    yarn install
    yarn start
    ```
