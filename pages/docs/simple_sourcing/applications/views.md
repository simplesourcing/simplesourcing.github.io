Creating read views involves consuming one or more of the projection topics and writing them to a database suitable for querying. 

![Alt text](../../../../images/event-sourcing-projections.png?raw=true "Projections")

This is out of scope for Simple Sourcing, and it is up to the client to decide how to do this. 

The recommended option is to use [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) directly to do the desired transformation and aggregation
 either from the event stream or the aggregate topic to new projection topics. 
 Then use [Kafka Connect](https://www.confluent.io/product/connectors/) to stream the output of
these topics to a database or search/query engine of your choice.

In the example app (`examples/auction`) we have provided an example of writing the projection topics to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
using the [Kafka Connect MongoDB sink](https://www.confluent.io/connector/kafka-connect-mongodb-sink/)

Please take a look at the example for more details.
